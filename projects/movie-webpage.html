            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>Flicking Apart is a movie webpage project that me and my partner made. It was a project that required parent work as a way for students to practice their knowledge on CSS and HTML.</p>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>For the webpage movie project, me and my partner decided to make a fictional story about a lightbulb and LED light who were best friends trying to save one another. One of the character, Edison is seen to have his life shortened somehow and so it was up to Philip to see if he is able to save his best friend.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>One of the challenges that me and my partner had while working on the project was making the a large section of space between the texts of the story from the each other to add suspension to the webpage project. It was also important for us to make sure that we use our time in class together wisely to finish making the project so that we can easily communicate with each other in person than working on it outside of school. </p>
            <p>One of my major takeaway from this project was that working and putting what I have learned in class into work and making a project is important to showcase my knowledge and practice my codes. It was also important to understand the true value of working together with someone and actually communicating the ideas and thoughts together to make the project as best as possible.</p>
            <p>For my next steps, I would've added more content in the story line and to decorate the movie webpage more if we had more time and creativity ideas.</p>
